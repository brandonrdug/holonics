//! **The host reference: the exact implementation of the execution port, and the exposure.**
//!
//! [definition] [`Reference`] implements [`ExecutionPort`] exactly (design (c), "The host
//! reference"). Its [`Resident`] holds the field, the lift point, the constitution, the open
//! moments, the open pending ratios and the staged deposits. Every value is in ℚ, in `ℚ(θ)` at a
//! face, or an enclosure read at the exterior; nothing is committed or rounded, and no float exists.
//!
//! [definition] **The resident's clock law** (design (c), R2 M12). `ingest` stops at the joint
//! clock's carry-out and the resident then refuses further cells until `close_aeon`, which it refuses
//! at any other time. Keys are located only between `close_aeon` and the next ingest, from the crib
//! that closed the aeon: at most the closed aeon's own last cells, already ingested and read
//! (review D1; [`crate::hnn::keys::locate_closing`]). Re-keying moves only `λ`'s phase classes and
//! leaves every open moment untouched.
//!
//! [definition] **The compare's composition** ([`compose`]): the word's return
//! ([`crate::hnn::Word::pull_back`]) is carried to every locus:
//!
//! ```text
//! R        sample (P_R^(τ_R) v_R(e_j), −g_j) per receiving phase                   normal law
//! W_c,g    sample (c_t, −u_t) at each tick of the element's window                  normal law
//! E_g      sample (M_g[c], −P^(c−τ_g) s̄_g(0)) per phase with counts                  normal law
//! f_g      G = (K̄ + K̄ᵀ) f,  K̄ = Σ_t u_t x̄_tᵀ;   slices ∂/∂u_ρ = σ_ρ[(x̄·v)u − (u·v)x̄], ∂/∂v_ρ likewise
//! q_g      the class covector g_σρ = Σ_t Re⟨u_t, A_ρ x̄_t⟩ carried to q by the transpose of q ↦ Δ
//! E_g^(δ)  ∂/∂e_ρ = Σ_c w_ρc h_c,  ∂/∂a_ρ = Σ_c (e_ρ·h_c) C_g(δ)[c] b_ρ, ∂/∂b_ρ likewise, h_c = P^(c−τ) s̄(0)
//! c,b,F    C̄ = Σ 2 r̄ (w − ω)ᵀ,  K̄ = −h Σ r̄ (u + ½hω)ᵀ,  D̄ = −h Σ r̄ ωᵀ;  ∂/∂c = (C̄ + C̄ᵀ) c, …
//! ```
//!
//! each only at loci inside the causal diamond of the source rings and the pending ratio's
//! receiver, and each statistic only over the locus's time-indexed window
//! ([`crate::hnn::retention::Diamond`]).
//!
//! [definition] **The Holon, the Holarchy and the aeon at the mount.** A mount is the resident's
//! declaration: it certifies that the field at the mounted constitution is a Holarchy that glues
//! (`Field::holon`, `Holon::interconnect`'s typed gluing, refused with its defect), and it keeps
//! that Holarchy's parametric orientation ([`crate::holarchy::Holarchy::parametric`], the lift of
//! the rings' joint clock torus) as the complex of every aeon it reads. The resident's aeon is an
//! [`crate::aeon::Aeon`] on it, carried by its opening lift point and read at the boundary through
//! the aeon owners ([`crate::hnn::retention::aeon_readings`]).
//!
//! [definition] **The first law over an aeon** ([`crate::aeon::EnclosedLedger`], Lean
//! `Aeon/Production/FirstLaw.{ledger_telescopes, enclosed_telescopes}`). A compare's code length
//! `ℓ_k(Θ_k)` arrives through the unchanged constitution, an exchange step
//! `ℓ_k(Θ_k) − ℓ_(k−1)(Θ_k)` from the occurrence reached; a deposit re-reads the arrived targets at
//! the successor, a deposition step `ℓ_k(Θ_(k+1)) − ℓ_k(Θ_k)`; a collapse that releases a locus the
//! arrived targets' diamond reads re-reads them, the released part counted as exchange (otherwise
//! the collapse changes no admitted reading, exactly). The steps chain, so they telescope to the
//! aeon's change of code length, and `close_aeon` returns the aeon's balance with the face against
//! the literal beside it.
//!
//! [definition] **The exposure** ([`Reference::expose`], design (d), campaign 1's protocol): the cut,
//! exactly the field's declared population (so the `n*` guard holds), is read in order, as one
//! stream, into one moment; at each receiving window `refine` runs on the moment and `compare`
//! against the next `A` cells, whose return is deposited on the training part and discarded on the
//! held-out part; then those cells are ingested; the aeon boundary is the joint clock's carry-out,
//! and after it keys are located on the crib that closed the aeon: its last `W_crib` cells, past
//! and already scored, truncated after the last held-out cell so no held-out cell is read (review
//! D1). The budget stop admits no further deposit and the run continues, reported incomplete. A
//! deadline ([`Reference::with_deadline`]) ends the reading after its windows, reported incomplete
//! at the cell it stopped at. Its readout ([`Exposure`]) is design (f)'s measurement, with `Kt`
//! charging the published keys, and beside it, exterior, the host's wall time by phase
//! ([`WallTimes`]).
//!
//! [definition; agent-inferred] **The kept read.** `refine` keeps the word it ran (its operands and
//! per-tick waves without the borrow of its field, `hnn::word::KeptWord`) and the faces it
//! read, in the pending slot, tagged with the commit of the constitution it read them at. `compare`
//! takes them when that commit is still the published one and reads again otherwise (a comparison
//! observed after an update is read through the contemporary constitution); a deposit and a
//! collapse publish a constitution and drop every kept read. A word is a function of the pending
//! ratio's operands and the published constitution, so the kept read is that function's value and
//! the compare returns the same either way (the test
//! `a_compare_returns_the_same_with_and_without_the_refines_kept_read`). The pending ratio still
//! holds operands only (guard 3), the kept word is consumed by its own return (guard 2), and the
//! kept read is not state: the state bits do not count it, and a clone of the resident drops it.
//!
//! [definition; agent-inferred] **The host realization** (CLAUDE.md, the hardware law;
//! `hnn::realization`). Within a method the host runs these regions together on its cores:
//! the work-stealing pool of the `rayon` crate, one task per region, regions nested in regions, each
//! region's own arithmetic on one worker. Every region reads operands no region writes and writes
//! only its own slot; the slots are collected in index order and every reduction runs afterwards in
//! that order, so every value is the serial realization's, which is the same code on one worker
//! (the test `one_worker_and_many_return_the_same_values`).
//!
//! | Where | Regions that run together | Why they commute |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | a word's open (`refine`, `compare`'s read, the deposit's re-read) | the rings' operands, then the contacts'; within them, a Gram's rows and a solved chart's product's columns | each reads its own material (the standings, its own screws) and writes its own operands |
//! | a tick of the word | the junctions, then the elements, then the transits; each fixed operand's rows; the rings' and contacts' power terms | a junction reads its own storage and arrivals, an element its own junction, a transit its two ends' outgoing waves and its own state; the balance terms and the power are summed afterwards in ring, then contact, order |
//! | the receiving read | the receiving epochs; within each, the map's `2\|A\|` rows, then the classes' grain cells | each row and class reads the shared anchor and writes its own logit or cell |
//! | the faces and the Holon ratio | the receiving phases' faces, then their ratios and code lengths | each reads its own read and target |
//! | `pull_back` | the rings' transposed solves and the contacts' `M_a⁻¹`; per step in reverse, the junctions, then the elements (and each transposed solve's rows), then the transits (and each channel coordinate), then the junctions' reverse Swings (and each coordinate) | each reads its step's record and its own covectors, and writes its own; the conductance terms are added afterwards, in contact, then ring and incidence, order |
//! | [`compose`] | the receiving map's gradient by row blocks; the rings (their ticks' charts, slices and contrast port's rows); the standings; the source ring's phases and pair-port ranks; the contacts (their ticks' charts and three forms) | each reads the word's return and its own material; the parts are joined in ring and contact order, so the deposit's steps stand in the serial order |
//! | `deposit` ([`Constitution::deposited`]) | the loci the deposit names, each running its own steps in the deposit's order with its own budgeted carry; within a normal law, its samples' terms, its map update's row blocks, its Gram's rows and its carried entries | loci share no material, remainder or budgeted carry, and entries share nothing; the refusal returned is the first in the deposit's order |
//!
//! The regions stay serial where their arithmetic is another owner's: an exact inversion and
//! `IntegralMatrix::{outer_sum, symmetric_times}` (`crate::ratio::linear`) run on one worker each,
//! and are the widest ring's serial path. The receipt (24 windows of the standing real cut, before
//! and after, identical readouts) is the notebook's (`research/notebook/hnn_design/README.md`).
//!
//! [open] **`ExactWork`'s operation counts.** The exposure's work counts the entries written, their
//! bits, the peak, the resident entries and the span; its additions, multiplications and divisions
//! stay zero. They are the integer multiply-adds and the normalizations (one `gcd` each) of
//! `ratio::linear::vector::{integer_dot, row_dot, IntegralMatrix::{outer_sum, to_rows,
//! symmetric_times}, combination}`, `ExactRatMatrix::{apply, inverse}`, the ticks'
//! `propagation::{Rows::apply, junction_swing, element_step, transit, global_power}`, the return,
//! [`compose`], and the deposit's `gram_sum`, normal law and carry; counting them needs an
//! `ExactWork` threaded through each of those owners' loops (most outside `hnn`), so they are left
//! uncounted rather than estimated from shapes.
